                    Cows actually are gentle and friendly! Most of us would think that cows are kept in homes 
                    just for milk or meat, but they can be great pets too, filling the owner’s heart with joy and love. 
                    This page acknowledges their beauty and shows you what lovely animals cows can be.

                Though they may not immediately come to mind when you think of cute and 
                cuddly creatures, cows are just as friendly and fun as any canine or feline. Not only that, 
                but they are also extremely intelligent animals—so intelligent, in fact, that they can experience emotions ranging from love and affection to anger and aggression.
                Take a look at cute photos of cow when you feel a bit moo-dy.
